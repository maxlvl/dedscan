// TODO:

// create public function called enumerate
// call crt.sh's api endpoint and specify output to be json
// declare a CrtEntryResult struct and specify what it should be depending on the response
// filter and deduplicate the responses and pour that into a hashSet (TBD)

// when that is done - declare a SubDomain struct that contains the subdomain info and open_ports, then pour your existing
// subdomains into a Vec of that struct with a non-initialized open_ports (as you'll add that in the port scanner
